# Sadivnyk course project

Sadivnyk is a course project for Internet-programming subject in my university. Sadivnyk as itself is real-life offline shop of horticultural goods which I know well, so I decided to try to bring it to the Worldwide Web by making an online-shop for them. Main technology used in project is Node.JS with Express framework and a lot of other libraries and packages that will be described later.

## Architecture

Main architecture pattern used in project is of course MVC (Model-View-Controller) that helps to separate business logic from view.
